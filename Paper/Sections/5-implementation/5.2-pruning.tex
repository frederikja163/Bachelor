\subsection{Pruning}\label{sec:pruning}

Some of the semantics from \cref{subsec:semantics} can lead to TA of an explosive size.
An optional pruning step is performed on the automaton, in order to remove transitions, states,
and clocks, that do not affect the transition system.
This leads to better performance (see \cref{subsec:benchmarks}), and better readability. 
%TODO: Affirm claims made about performance after benchmarks

Throughout this section the TA seen on \cref{fig:prune0} will be used as an example of how the prunings work.
The TA is equivalent to the TReg $A_{[1;10]}+'$

\subsubsection{Dead Edge Pruning}\label[subsubsection]{deadEdgePruning}
Edges that are overconstrained on one or more clocks, are considered "dead" edges, and can be removed without changing the language of the automaton.
Since these edges could never be taken by any transition system, it does not change the language to remove them.
Dead edge pruning is formally defined in \cref{definition:deadEdgePruning}.

\input{Documents/Definitions/PruneSemantics/DeadEdge.tex}

\subsubsection{Unreachable State Pruning}\label[subsubsection]{unreachableStatePruning}
States that are not the destination of any transition or the initial state, are considered "unreachable" states, and can be removed without changing the language of the automaton.
When this rule is applied until continuously, it removes any part of the automaton that is unreachable from the initial state of the TA.
Since these states could never be reached, they were not part of the transition system for any words recognized by the automaton, hence it does not change the language to remove them.
Unreachable state pruning is formally defined in \cref{definition:unreachableStatePruning}

\subsubsection{Dead State Pruning}\label[subsubsection]{deadStatePruning}
States that are not final states, or the source of any transition,
are considered "dead" states, and can be removed without changing the language of the automaton.
This rule, when applied recursively, effectively removes any branches of the automaton, that do not end in a final state.
Since these states can not reach final states, they were not part of the transition system for any words recognized by the automaton, hence it does not change the language to remove them.
Dead state pruning is formally defined in \cref{definition:deadStatePruning}.

\input{Documents/Definitions/PruneSemantics/DeadState.tex}

\subsubsection{Dead Clock Pruning}\label[subsubsection]{deadClockPruning}
Clocks that are never used in ranges to constrain any edges are considered "dead", and can be removed without changing the language of the automaton.
Since these clocks never constrain any transitions, it does not change the possible ways to reach final states, hence it does not change the language to remove them.
This rule is formally defined in \cref{definition:deadClockPruning}
