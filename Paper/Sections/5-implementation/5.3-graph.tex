\subsection{Graph Layout}

% Motivation for implementing algorithm ourselves
%   - alternative: use DOT language for Graphviz. 
%       - too much bloat and better understanding of algorithm if implemened manually
% Sugiyama framework
%   - 4 steps
%       - make graph acyclic
%           - mention trivial solution?
%       - assign states to layers
%       - order states in layers
%       - assign positions

As mentioned earlier, the layout algorithm used in (TODO: Insert name of program) to organize and arrange the states in timed automata, is called the Sugiyama framework, also known as layered graph drawing (TODO: cite sugiyama when \#343 merged). The method comprises four steps that, when combined, results in a layered graph with minimized edge crossings.

\subsubsection{Make automata acyclic}
The first step of the Sugiyama framework is to make the automata acyclic. As described by Mazetti, this is done by reversing a specific selection of edges \cite{Mazetti2012}.
