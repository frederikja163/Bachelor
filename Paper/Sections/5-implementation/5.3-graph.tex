\subsection{Graph Layout}

% Motivation for implementing algorithm ourselves
%   - alternative: use DOT language for Graphviz. 
%       - too much bloat and better understanding of algorithm if implemened manually
% Sugiyama framework
%   - 4 steps
%       - make graph acyclic
%       - assign states to layers
%       - order states in layers
%       - assign positions
