\subsection{Pruning}\label[subsection]{pruning}

Some of the semantics from \cref{subsec:semantics} can lead to automata of an explosive size. An optional pruning step is performed on the automaton, in order to remove transitions, states, and clocks, that do not affect the transition system. This leads to better performance (see \cref{subsec:benchmarks}), and better readability. \\
