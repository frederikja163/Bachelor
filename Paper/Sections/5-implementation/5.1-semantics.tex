Most of the semantics have been copied directly from the paper by Eugene et al. \cite{Eugene2001}. However we have made a few modifications.

\subsubsection{Intersection}
When creating automata using an intersection with the rules from Eugene et al.
many states are created with no transitions.
By creating the intersection states lazily as needed for transitions we can greatly decrease the amount of states created.
% TODO: Possibly insert a figure here.

\subsubsection{Union}
