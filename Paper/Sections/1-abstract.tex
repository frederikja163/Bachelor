\textbf{Timed Automata (TAs) are commonly used to verify correct behaviour in real-time systems. Examples could include, finding vital issues in airplane instrumentation, long delays in radio transcriptions and detecting attacks on server infrastructure. Constructing TAs for these use cases, can be enhanced by using Timed Regular Expressions (TREs).}

\textbf{The goal of this paper is to construct Timed Automata from Timed Regular Expressions while optimizing both performance and readability. This is done by defining a number of pruning steps, which eliminate redundant elements in the generated Timed Automata. Along with pruning, implementing an effective layout algorithm further increases visual clarity. The efficiency of this implementation is shown through examples and benchmarks, which also highlight issues, eliciting possible future improvement.}
