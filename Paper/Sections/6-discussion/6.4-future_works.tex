\subsubsection{Pruning}\label{futureWorks:pruning}
A paper by Daws et al. \cite{Daws1996} describes clock pruning in timed automata. There are several methods of pruning clocks, that are not part of TREAT at the time of writing this paper.
Clock pruning is one example of an area in which further optimization may be found. It should be noted, however, that adding several more pruning steps, might decrease performance in certain areas.
This conundrum should be adressed with testing and benchmarking, to determine which pruning algorithms would effectively improve performance in relevant areas.

A pruning method that was previously in development for TREAT, was "final state pruning", in which, final states would be merged together.



- Clock
- Final state
This is possible, but we could not find a formal definition that works.
