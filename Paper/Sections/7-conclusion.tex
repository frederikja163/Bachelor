\section{Conclusion}
"TREAT", short for "Timed Regular Expression to Automaton Transformation", is a software product developed for the purpose of allowing a user to convert timed regular expressions (TREs) to timed automata (TAs).
It allows the user to output the TA to TikZ or UPPAAL.
When outputting to UPPAAL, the user can check timed words against the TRE, for data analysis.
The development of this program has required research that has uncovered issues with established methods of performing this transformation, such as those described by Eugene et al. \cite{Eugene2001}.
Optimizing these transformation steps, and pruning the resulting TA, has led to more minimized versions of the generated automata. This, along with a graphing algorithm, results in automata that are more human readable overall, than those that would otherwise result from explosive operations on the TRE.

The success of these efforts to create readable TAs, can be evaluated through the figures in \cref{subsec:readability}, and the performance enhancement, resulting from the pruning steps, can be seen in the benchmarks found in %\cref{app:benchmarks}
and described in \cref{subsec:benchmarks}.

TREAT is successful in allowing a user to easily check a TRE, and get a readable visual representation of the resulting TA.
