Our paper "Timed Regular Expression to Automaton Transformation", describes the research process, implementation and functionality of the software product of the same name.
Shortened to "TREAT", the software seeks to streamline the use of timed regular expressions (TREs), as well as serve as a tool for visualising TREs as timed automata(TAs).

An existing software product called "MONAA" is used for timed pattern matching on timed words. In this regard, it accomplishes a similar goal to TREAT, in so far as matching timed words to regular expressions, though MONAA functions somewhat differently in its use.
MONAA also falls short of implementing certain operations, outlined in a paper by Eugene et al.\cite{Eugene2001}, which TREAT borrows closely from.

When performing timed pattern matching, TREAT requires the assistance of "UPPAAL". UPPAAL is a tool that allows visualisation and simulation of timed automata.
