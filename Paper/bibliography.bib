  abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both Büchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (Π11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.}

  abstract = {Let G=(V, A) denote a simple connected directed graph, and let n=|V|, m=|A|, where nt-1≤m≤(n2) A feedback arc set (FAS) of G, denoted R(G), is a (possibly empty)set of arcs whose reversal makes G acyclic. A minimum feedback arc set of G, denoted R∗(G), is a FAS of minimum cardinality r∗(G); the computation of R∗(G) is called the FAS problem. Berger and Shor have recently published an algorithm which, for a given digraph G, computes a FAS whose cardinality is at most m/2t-c1m/Δ1/2 where Δ is the maximum degree of G and c1 is a constant. Further, they exhibited an infinite class G of graphs with the property that for every GϵG and some constant c2, r∗(G)≥m /2t-c2m/Δ1/2. Thus the Berger-Shor algorithm provides, in a certain asymptotic sense, an optimal solution to the FAS problem. Unfortunately, the Berger-Shor algorithm is complicated and requires runni ng time O(mn). In this paper we present a simple FAS algorithm which guarantees a good (though not optimal) performance bound and executes in time O(m). Further, for the sparse graphs which arise frequently in graph drawing and other applications, our algorithm achieves the same asymptotic performance bound that Berger-Shor does.}
