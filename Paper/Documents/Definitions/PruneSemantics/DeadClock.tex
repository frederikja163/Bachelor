Any clocks that are not used in any intervals can be removed.
This means removing them both from the clocks set and from any clock resets.
This shouldn't have a huge impact, but it will allow us to create a more minimal declaration field in Uppaal.

\sembox{
    $\deadclock(A_1)=\automaton[][Q_1][C][\Delta][\Sigma_1][s_1][F_1]$
    
    $C=\{c|\exists\transition[_1]\in\Delta_1:\langle c\in I\rangle\in\Phi_1\}$

    $\Delta=\{\transition[_1]\in\Delta_1|\transition[][q_1][q_1'][\Phi_1][p\backslash C]\}$
